# Serverless Container Orchestration with AWS Fargate
#### Overview

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a **serverless microservices system** using AWS Fargate to deploy and manage containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.

#### Technologies Used

- **AWS Fargate** - Serverless compute engine for containers
- **Amazon ECS** - Container orchestration service
- **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution and load balancing
- **Amazon Aurora Serverless** - Serverless database
- **Amazon ECR** - Container registry
- **AWS CodePipeline** - CI/CD automation
